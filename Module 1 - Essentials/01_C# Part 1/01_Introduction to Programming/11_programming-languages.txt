Problem 11. Programming Languages

Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?
Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

Java - similar to C#, object oriented, uses garbage collector too. Both use curly braces. Does not support unsigned integers.
HTML - HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create Web pages. Statements are declared in tags.
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. (HTML and similar)
Javascript - a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. Object oriented.
PHP - a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Not object oriented.
