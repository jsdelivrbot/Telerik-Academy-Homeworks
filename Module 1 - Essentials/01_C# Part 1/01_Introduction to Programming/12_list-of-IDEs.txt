Eclipse - interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework. Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is fully extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.
Netbeans - extensible and free, and it compiles code which is a bonus. It comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer for your testing environment.
Flashdevelop - for development of Adobe Flash websites, web applications and desktop applications. The resulting applications run in Adobe Flash Player or the Adobe Integrated Runtime, on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Android or iOS. Written in C#.
Dreamweaver - web development tool developed by Adobe Systems. Supports for Web technologies such as CSS, JavaScript, and various server-side scripting languages and frameworks including ASP (ASP JavaScript, ASP VBScript, ASP.NET C#, ASP.NET VB), ColdFusion, Scriptlet, and PHP.
Code Blocks - an open-source cross-platform. Its pluggable architecture enables it to be extended easily by the use of external plugins (most of its functionality is provided by plugins)
